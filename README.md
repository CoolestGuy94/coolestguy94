## Hi. I'm **CoolestGuy94**.
Currently known for *nothing*. I'll might start uploading *NBT*'s for some *Minecraft* items here

If you don't familiar with *NBT*'s, this is a *data* stored inside your item, block. It sometimes stored inside the *player* or *entity*.
It's like an... organism? 
I don't really know how to explain this one.

Oh, almost forgot. Here is my useless README.md's card:
